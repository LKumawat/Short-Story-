This is my story, hello. I was walking along the street and saw a zebra wearing sunglasses.
I, being the socially awkward butterfly I am, said, "Hello Mr. Zebra. I hope you are having a good 
morning", despite the fact that it was evening.

This is the end of my story. Hope you like zebras.

Hey, This is Lalita. I am going to make very small changes in you story... Never mind.
